Relevation is aimed at anyone wishing to collection relevance assessment for information retrieval evaluation evaluation.

## Feautures

Relevation! is build using Python's Django web framework and Twitter's Bootstrap.

## Setup Steps

1. Checkout relevation from github with: `git clone https://github.com/ielab/relevation.git`
2. Copy your documents into the `relevation/documents` folder.
3. Start Relevation! by running `./manage.py runserver`. Relevation! will be running at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
4. Go to Setup page and upload your queries and document pool. (Queries are in the form queryId[tab]queryText; the pool is in standard TREC results format.)

IMPORTANT:
  The queries can only be added once. Otherwise this software crushes.
  The pool is not exactly TREC results format. It requires exactly one additional column after the "qid Q0 docno rank score" columns: "qid Q0 docno rank score comment". Otherwise it will crush.
  I havn't figure out how to re-start a new pooling section. The only way I know is to delete, clone, and re-start : (.
  

You can also look at a demo that shows how to setup Relevation! from scratch; the demo is available at [https://vimeo.com/ielab/relevation](https://vimeo.com/ielab/relevation).
